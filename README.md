# JapaneseWordMatch
This is a simple app that will scramble the word and user has to guess the correct word
The words will be in Japanese as well as the entire app.
I'm learning how to use ViewModels with fragments. I will be using live data and databinding
to automatically update the ui with any changes to the data.
I will also be learning about themes and how to have both dark and light themes for the app.
I will be holding the words to be screambled in the strings resourse file.
